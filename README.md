## Inspiration
Yes

## What it does
The Inflator Raider app incorporates the process of extracting historic prices of items and demonstrating the pattern observed in the rates. It also gives the user an idea of how much the product is being sold for, at different vendors along with an indication of increase or decrease in the item's price. This enables an option for user to price match it at the vendor at hand or purchase from the cheapest option. 

The 4-CLICK process prioritizes respectful communication and presents content and functionality in ways that everyone can access and understand. A high emphasis has been put on Accessibility features for the app to enable seamless and widespread adaption, taken into account a diverse range of human perspectives, abilities, and backgrounds.
